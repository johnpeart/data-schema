# Data schema

This technical guidance has been developed as part of the [UK digital identity and attributes trust framework]([url](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework)).
 
The data schema enables services to exchange data while remaining technology agnostic. It provides guidance for describing the checks that identity service providers (IDSPs) and component services providers (CSPs) undertake in a consistent way, by specifying predefined values for discussing different aspects of these checks.
 
The data schema includes sections for:
  1. core identity claims;
  2. assurance processes;
  3. proofing processes; and
  4. identity evidence.
 
It has been written to be consistent with and not in conflict with different industry approaches for data exchange and technical standards.
 
Following the data schema is not mandatory under the trust framework, but both industry and the public sector have asked DSIT to provide this guidance to encourage interoperability. By following the guidance, IDSPs and CSPs can enable data to be exchanged consistently between trust framework participants and other organisations, such as relying parties.
