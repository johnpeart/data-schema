# Data schema

This technical guidance has been developed as part of the UK digital identity and attributes trust framework alpha.

The aim of the data schema is to provide guidance on how to describe the checks that an identity service provider (IDSP) undertakes in a consistent way.

The data schema can help IDSPs understand how to describe and share with relying parties in a consistent manner.

The guidance is not mandatory under the trust framework, but it is something that both industry and the public sector have asked for DCMS to define. 

It has been written to be consistent and not in conflict with different industry approaches for data exchange and technical standards.The data schema includes sections for: 
1) core identity claims 
2) assurance processes 
3) proofing processes 
4) Identity evidence "

The data schema provides practical guidance on how to describe checks that identity service providers have undertaken, and provides predefined values on how the checks can be shared by an IDSPs to other other organisations such as a relying party.
